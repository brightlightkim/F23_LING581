# Introduction to LING 581

## NLP

* NLP vs Computational Linguistics
* HUGE, Interdisciplinary field
  * Linguistics (Morphology, Syntax, Phonetics/Phonology, Semantics, Discourse, etc.)
  * Computer Science (Data structures, algorithms, complexity, etc.)
  * Machine learning (Supervised algorithms, Unsupervised algorithms, cross-validation, etc.)
  * Mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, Graph Theory, etc.)
  * Nobody knows everything about NLP.
* Common tasks
  * Information retrieval
    * Finds documents that satisfy an information need from within large collections
  * Named entity recognition
    * Locate and classify entities into predefined categories such as person
      names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions,
      quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
  * Relation extraction
    * Extracts semantic relationships from the text, which usually occur between two or more entities
  * Text classification/Document Classification
    * Assigns a text/document to one or more classes or categories.
  * Document Ranking
  * Annotation
  * Topic modelling
    * Discovers the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents
  * Keyword Extraction
  * Machine translation
  * Parts of speech tagging
    * Process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech
  * Semantic Role Labeling
    * Indicates the semantic role in the sentence, such as that of an agent, goal, or result
  * Word Sense Disambiguation
    * Identifies which sense of a word is used in a sentence
  * Grammatical Error Correction
  * Semantic textual similarity
    * Determines how similar two pieces of texts are.

## Course overview

### Goals and methods

* Stepping stone to becoming an NLP researcher (not just a user)
* Coding ability is assumed (preferably Python)
* You are an active participant in planning, teaching, discussing, etc.
* There is a waitlist
  * If your primary motivation for reading or doing homework is the grade, please drop the class
  * If this is not a topic you can be passionate about, please drop the class

* (Almost) every week...
  * Mon: Reading from textbook chapter (discussion led by assigned student)
    * Short (<5 mins) summary of chapter (slides optional)
    * Dig into important/difficult parts
      * Math equations
      * algorithms
    * Find other resources that may help facilitate discussion
      * Tutorials
      * Images/Visualizations
      * Youtube videos
  * Wed: Reading research article (discussion led by assigned student)
    * You can help choose the article, if desired
    * Short (<5 mins) summary of chapter (slides optional)
    * Dig into important/difficult parts
    * Evaluation/criticism of article's methodology/results
  * Fri: Coding workshop applying what we learned
    * Come having made your best effort to complete assigned exercises
    * We will show working examples, compare solutions
    * Expand/explore new applications

* Last month of course is primarily reserved for final projects
  * Optional readings
  * Short summary lectures/discussion led by me

### Final project

* Any substantial NLP project, potentially including the following...
  * Collecting a new corpus
  * Labeling a new corpus
  * Training a new model for an NLP task
  * Performing formal description/evaluation of an NLP model
  * Comparing performance of different algorithms on the same task

The final exam for this course consists of either an in-class presentation
(during last couple classes and our final exam slot during Finals Week) or a
6-8 page paper (due at the end of Finals Week) summarizing your final project.

### Communication

  * Learning community (including me!)
  * Learning Suite "Digital Dialog"
  * Slack, Teams, Discord, etc.?

> These are difficult topics, so ask questions!!!

## Questions?

* Who wants to lead discussions this week?
