# How to read a scholarly article

## Pre-reading

1. Read abstract (and determine if you should read more)
2. Read "Conclusions" (and determine if you should read more)
3. Scan over tables and figures and their captions to get a sense of what results
   they are reporting (and determine if you should read more)

PS: For assigned readings, you should ***always*** read more. ;)

## Reading

1. Do not spend too much time trying to understand parts of the article that
   seem too far afield from what we are studying.
2. Try to summarize each section before you move on.

### Introduction / Previous work / Related work

These sections give you context about what problem the authors are solving,
what has already been done, and why their work is interesting/relevant.

### Methods / Methodology

An explanation of what the authors did, usually including some kind of
theoretical, mathematical or pseudocode justification/implementation. These
sections also frequently include explanation of how the method is to be
evaluated/tested.

### Results

The results of the evaluation/test experiments. Usually includes at least a
couple tables or figures.

### Discussion / Conclusions

Statements about the significance and limitations of the results in the context
of broader research. Restates all findings of the article in a very condensed
format.

### References / Citations

Citations for all articles cited in above in the article, using a standard
citation format, such as Chicago, APA, etc. Most conferences provide a LaTeX
template that generates this section automatically from your Bibtex entries.

## Taking notes

* What problems do you see in their methodology/approach?
* How would you change their methods to be more precise?
* What things are inspiring? (clever uses of limited resources, etc.)
* How could you extend their research? What questions do their results raise?
  (Good research doesn't answer all the questions; it leads to more good research.)
